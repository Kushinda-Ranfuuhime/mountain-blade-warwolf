Apparently there's some text desync? I changed the bandit quests to sound more gruff and informal, tell me if it's too shit, I'm not a native English speaker either.

So should I include jumpattack? Looks like a lot of people want it for some reason, not that I care since I'm a whore's archer.

Game crashes and I don't know why, I didn't change shit besides localization.

**Juice is used to prevent Scurvy, which only occurs when you're on ships.**

**I recall someone changing the Troops.txt in thread, if he sees this could you put it on pastebin or something?**

**The Merchant Start has an advantage in that you can buy and sell Checkbooks to carry more than 150k money (50k Bank + 100k on your person)**
