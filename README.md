>Included the Menu.txt from Carlos all the way back


Apparently there's some text desync? Banned from /vg/ until saturday morning Chinatime (Friday Night burgertime) nd M&B is uninstalled on my shitty laptop, someone test it and post a cap in thread...or not. Wonder if anyone is even watching anymore, that guy who was doing menus.txt didn't do anything afterwards afaik. I changed the bandit quests to sound more gruff and informal, tell me if it's too shit, I'm not a native English speaker either.

So should I include jumpattack? Looks like a lot of people want it for some reason, not that I care since I'm a whore's archer.

Game crashes and I don't know why, I didn't change shit besides localization.

**I recall someone changing the Troops.txt in thread, if he sees this could you put it on pastebin or something?**
