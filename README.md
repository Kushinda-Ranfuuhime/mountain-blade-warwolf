**Juice from the night market is used to prevent Scurvy, which only occurs when you're on ships - it's basically just orange juice. Might rename it to Citrus.**
**The Merchant Start has an advantage in that you can buy and sell Checkbooks to carry more than 150k money (50k Bank + 100k on your person)**
**The Pirate Start gives you an extra boat. There is no other way of getting an extra boat.**
**Morale affects the runaway rate, which is very fucking high at sub-60, you'll have half the army leave before combat is over**
**Train seems to basically be their general fighting proficiency, it feels like a stat buff at all levels**

Cleaning up Warwolf by Feodor.

Upstab / Crouching, attack-while-jumping and a partially edited menus.txt is included.
Strings.txt is almost done.
Hopeful that we can stuff in the models and textures from Warphilia again, the hair assets in particular are sorely missed. Fuck modders wailing about their stolen assets. It's not as easy as dropping it in and editing module.ini though, apparently.
The files you should download are Menus.txt, Strings.txt, module.ini and item_kinds1.txt - the others are not edited. You'll also need the 1257_ani.brf in the resource folder, which you can grab from either the github or from the resource folder.
